### NS Records
When applying for NS records, please be aware we already support a [wide range of DNS records](https://is-a.dev/docs/faq/#which-records-are-supported), so you may not need them. 

In your PR, please provide sufficient reasoning of why you need NS records, to help us mitigate potential abuse. It is helpful to refer to the [FAQ](https://is-a.dev/docs/faq/#who-can-use-ns-records) to see if you will likely be approved for NS records or not. You can see a good example of a request for NS records [here](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register/pull/17592).

***Pull requests adding NS records without sufficient reasoning will be closed.***
